Enversion is a server-side tool that sits in front of your Subversion
repositories and validates incoming commits.  It can detect a wide variety
of problematic commits (over 80) and will block them at the pre-commit stage.

Enversion was designed specifically for enterprise Subversion deployments,
which have vastly different usage patterns than typical open source Subversion
repositories.
